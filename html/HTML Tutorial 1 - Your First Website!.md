# Chapter 1 : Your Very First Website!
  
Hi there, welcome to the first HTML tutorial!
In this chapter, we'll create our very first website, which will display a simple message to the user.
It's basic, but I guarantee we'll be building cool websites in no time!

## Setup
First, create a new file with the extension ".html".
I'll call my HTML file "HTML (1) - First Website.html", however feel free to call it whatever you want!
Open the file and type in the code.

After you've entered the code, save the file and open it in a web browser (like Chrome or Firefox). You should see the result come up - a nice welcome to HTML!

## Code
[Program 1: First Website](code/HTML%20(1)%20-%20First%20Website.html)

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Your Very First Website!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Welcome to HTML!</h1>
        <p>This is my very own website! Do you like it? :)</p>
    </body>
</html>
```   
  
## Result

**Welcome to HTML!**  
This is my very own website! Do you like it? :)
