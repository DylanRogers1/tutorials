# Chapter 2 : What are tags?
  
Tags are a really important part of HTML.
In this chapter, we'll explore what tags are and how we can create them!

## Creating tags

We can create a tag by surrounding a keyword with \<\>.
For example, we can use \<p\> to create a paragraph tag, or \<h1\> for a main heading tag.

We can put data (usually text) in these tags. This is called the tag's content.
For example, in a heading tag's content, we may have the text "Welcome to my website!".
I'll discuss how to set the content of a tag in a second!

## Opening and closing tags

There are two types of tags - opening tags and closing tags.
The closing tag is exactly the same as the opening tag, only with a '\/' after the '\<'.
For example, the opening tag of a paragraph is `<p>`, whereas its closing tag is `</p>`. We would therefore create an empty paragraph using `<p></p>`.

## Using tags

We can create a tag by putting an opening tag and then a closing tag.
Anything inside the tags is the tag content.
For example: `<p>Hello World</p>`.  
`<p>` is the opening tag, `</p>` is the closing tag, and "Hello World" is the content.
